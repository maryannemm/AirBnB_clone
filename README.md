AirBnB Clone Project
Description of the Project
The AirBnB Clone project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at building a web application that mimics the functionality of the popular accommodation rental platform, AirBnB. The project encompasses the creation of various classes representing different entities such as users, states, cities, and places, along with a command interpreter to manage these objects.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a crucial component of the AirBnB Clone project, providing users with the ability to interact with and manage objects within the application. Here's a brief overview of how to use it:

How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, execute the console.py script from the terminal:

bash
Copy code
$ ./console.py
How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the interpreter is running, you can enter various commands to manage objects. The prompt (hbnb) indicates that the interpreter is ready to receive commands. Here are some basic commands:

create: Create a new object (e.g., User, Place).
show: Display details of a specific object.
destroy: Remove an object.
all: Display all objects or objects of a specific type.
update: Modify attributes of an object.
For a complete list of commands and their usage, use the help command:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) help
Examples
Here are some examples of using the command interpreter:

Creating a new user:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) create User
Displaying information about a specific place:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) show Place 1234-5678
Updating the name of a user:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) update User 8765-4321 name "John Doe"
Quitting the command interpreter:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) quit
